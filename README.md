<b>History</b>

An excerpt from Wikipedia:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPad

"WordPad is a word processor software included with Windows 95 and later, until Windows 11. Similarly to its predecessor Microsoft Write, it is a basic word processor, positioned as more advanced than the Notepad text editor by supporting rich text editing, but with a subset of the functionality of Microsoft Word.

Earlier versions primarily supported a subset of the Rich Text Format (RTF, .rtf) and Microsoft Word 6.0 formats, although support for these formats were removed beginning with Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Vista respectively for security reasons. Current versions are capable of saving Office Open XML (OOXML, .docx) and OpenDocument Text (.odt) files.

In 2023, Microsoft announced that it plans to remove WordPad from future versions of Windows."
